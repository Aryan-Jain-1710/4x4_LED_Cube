## Purpose
I created this project as part of the annual science symposium in my junior year of high school. I wanted to create something that would be useful in teaching Maths and Physics. After some research, I decided to create a programmable LED Cube which would combine my interest in programming with a new experience of using hardware. 


## Project Overview
- The cube is made up of 64 LEDs arranged in a 4x4x4 matrix. 
- The cube is programmed using Arduino Uno. 
- The cube can be programmed to display various patterns like flickering, raining, etc. 
- The cube can be used to display 3-D graphs, etc. 
- The cube is programmed using C/C++.


## Setup
- The setting up involved starting from scratch and personally soldering each layer of the Cube. 
- Next step involved soldering resistors and transistors to the breadboard and linking the cube structure to the breadboard.


## Program and Methods
The code has three methods that display different patterns: flicker(), randomLED(), raining()
- flicker() displays LEDs but flickers them and decreases the interval time of the flickering.
- randomLED() turns on single LED randomly
- raining() turns on LEDs from specific columns one by one


## Applications
This cube can be of assistance while teaching Maths and Physics by helping in 3-D display of graphs in 3 axes, or difference between various waves, etc.
