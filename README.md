# 4x4x4 LED CUBE


This repository consists of the code for a progammable 4x4 LED CUBE, it contains the sketch of top view of the Cube for reference and two videos showing the functioning of the LED Cube. The progamming languages used are C/C++ 


## Setup

The setting up involved starting from scratch and personally soldering each layer of the Cube. Next step involeded soldering resistors and transistors to the breadbord and linking the cube structure to the breadboard.


## Program and Methods

The code has three methods that display different patterns: flicker(), randomLED(), raining()

- flicker() displays LEDs but flickers them and decreases the interval time of the flickering.
- randomLED() turns on single LED randomly
- raining() turns on LEDs from specific columns one by one


## Applications

This cube can be of assistance while teaching Maths and Physics by helping in 3-D display of graphs in 3 axes, or difference between various waves, etc.
